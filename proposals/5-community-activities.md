# Proposal 5: Community Activities

## Summary

This proposal seeks budget to run some community activities, to re-unite the community while at the same time give voice and talk about the things build on Juno. Objective is to have good coverage of everything we do, trough social media, blog posts, and more. Additionally we are proposing a set of daily activities that people can do on the [portal](./4-community-dapps.md), to get as much on-chain activity as possible.
