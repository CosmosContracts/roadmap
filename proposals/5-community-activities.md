# Juno Roadmap: Proposal 5 - Community Activities

_Note: This proposal is a draft, will be refined after the portal is live_
_Note2: Since most of these activities require a small commitee to handle the programs, we'll run candidatures on the forum to select the members._

## Summary

This proposal seeks budget to run some community activities, to re-unite the community while at the same time give voice and talk about the things build on Juno. Objective is to have good coverage of everything we do, trough social media, blog posts, and more. Additionally we are proposing a set of daily activities that people can do on the [portal](./4-community-dapps.md), to get as much on-chain activity as possible.

## Ambassador program

### Overview

The ambassador program seeks to reward community members who actively promote Juno across social media, blogs, video and other chnanels.
We propose to allocate a fixed monthly budget for this program, that will be distributed directly to contributors trough a voting system.

- The program will work in waves, one wave each month.
- During each month, contributors can create and publish content
- During each month, contributors are required to fill a form to be eligible for the prize distribution before the end of the month.
- Contributions are initially reviewed by a small committee, just to make sure content is not spam and it follows the guidelines
- At the start of the next month, contributions are published in the Juno Portal for voting
- Each juno staker, can allocate points to every content based on their own like
- At the end of the month votes are closed, and the prize is distributed proportionally to the votes received

Refer to this diagram for better understanding:

### Incentivization

To incentivize community voting, we propose to share a portion of the prize also to with the people who voted. To avoid people voting randomly, the commitee will highlight 3 top contributions discretionally based on the quality of the submission. The voting prize will be awarded only to the people who voted for the highlighted. The game, is to find the best content and vote for it.

### Full guidelines

The full ambassador program guidelines and committee members are available [here](../programs/ambassador-program.md).

### Budget

We propose an initial budget of 20,000 JUNO for each wave. Based on the program success, we can modify it to properly match the value generated. The funds are allocated directly to the smart contract handling the program. The sourcecode is available [here](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/).

## Bounty Program

###Â Overview

The bounty program seeks to reward community members for specific and strategic tasks that are choosed and awarded by a committee. It's different from the ambassador program because all the prizes will not be awarded based on community popularity but rather only discretionally by the committee itself. Additionally, since the bounty list is public, you can know in advance how much that task will be paid if done correctly.
