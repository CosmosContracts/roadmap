# Q2, Q3 and Q4 Budget for Digital Kitchen

## Summary

This proposal requests the release of the **Q2, Q3, Q4 budgets** outlined in [Roadmap Proposal 2](https://explorer.chainroot.io/juno/proposals/361), which appointed **Digital Kitchen** and **Kintsugi Tech** as the core teams maintaining and upgrading the Juno Blockchain.  
At the current JUNO market price of **$0.08**, we are adjusting the payment amounts accordingly.

As the workload for Kintsugi Tech in Q2, Q3, Q4 has been/will be minimal, **no funds are being requested for Kintsugi Tech** at this time.

## Future work (Q4)

## Updated Budget Request

The original budget outlined in the [Roadmap Proposal 2](https://explorer.chainroot.io/juno/proposals/361) was 20,000 JUNO for each team each quarter. Because of new pricing conditions, we are asking the payment of Q2, Q3, and Q4 budget only for Digital Kitchen at a rate of 0.08$ per token. Additionally we are integrating the juno budget with USDC budget, to minimize market impact as much as possible.

**Original budget (with token at 0.2$):** 60,000 JUNO (for Digital Kitchen only, 3 quarters)  
**Rebalanced budget (with token at 0.08$):** 75,000 JUNO + 6000 USDC (for Digital Kitchen only)  
**USD Equivalent:** 12,000 USD

Kintsugi tech will continue to provide support without compensation for now.

## Budget Handling

Funds will be sent to **Dimi’s wallet** (used in the Q1 proposal) who will handle the payments to Digital Kitchen as agreed. This ensures operational continuity and simplifies accounting.

Payment schedule is the following:

- Immediately 25,000 JUNO + 2000 USDC for Q2 work
- October 1st 25,000 JUNO + 2000 USDC for Q3 work
- Jan 1st 2026 25,000 JUNO + 2000 USDC for Q4 work

In case of high price fluctations, we might adjust the schedule to better fit the 4k USD/mo target of digital kitchen.

## Conclusion

- **Vote YES** to approve the release of Q2, Q3 and Q4 budgets (75,000 JUNO + 6000 USDC total) to fund Digital Kitchen’s continued work on Juno core.
- **Vote NO** if you oppose releasing the proposed funds or want to reassess team structure.
