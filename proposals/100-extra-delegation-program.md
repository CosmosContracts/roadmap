# Delegation Program

With this proposal, we are sending 5,000,000 JUNO from the community pool to the [Council SubDAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1nmezpepv3lx45mndyctz2lzqxa6d9xzd2xumkxf7a6r4nxt0y95qypm6c0/treasury). As you know, the Council SubDAO is currently inactive and has no members, which means these tokens cannot be spent in any way. The only action that can be performed from that account is delegation, thanks to an existing authorization to the [Delegation SubDAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1ehayefjmlty0zvqdjs2l7tkamtgq3jpuucrjjs568lhapxjcd3xs6rf8ma/home). Right now, this SubDAO has only Dimi as a member, but more members will be added once we find people willing to contribute to the Reviewer Committee.

The funds are not at risk, as only delegation transactions can be performed.

## The New Program

A total of 15,000,000 JUNO will be used to launch the new delegation program. A draft is already available [here](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/delegations/pull/3/files).

**tl;dr of the program:**

- Incentivize dApp development
- Support validator infrastructure on both mainnet and testnet
- Encourage content creation

## Conflict of Interest

Since Kintsugi will be the main party reviewing delegation applications—and since Kintsugi is also a validator applying to the program—we’ve already published the points we plan to assign to ourselves [here](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/delegations/blob/1f6a2df570c853509032135e2cf0ef1baed2f008/policy/delegations.md#kintsugi-validator--conflict-of-interest) so that you can review them and vote yes or no based on how you feel about it.

## Vote Options

- **Vote YES**: If you support the new delegation program and agree with sending additional tokens from the community pool to a SubDAO for delegation.
- **Vote NO**: If you don’t support the new program, disagree with its design, or don’t approve of the self-assigned points by Kintsugi.
- **Vote VETO**: If you want to burn my deposit.
- **Vote ABSTAIN**: If you’re unsure.
