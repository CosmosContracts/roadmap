# Juno Roadmap: Proposal 1

## Summary

**Purpose:**

Juno Network is currently at a critical juncture, facing significant challenges. At present, there is no dedicated team responsible for maintaining and optimizing the blockchain infrastructure to ensure its stability, scalability, and efficiency. Additionally, no substantial development or other ecosystem activities are underway. To address these issues and establish a sustainable path forward, we want to propose a roadmap for the Network, covering all 2025. This proposal is giving a general overview of what will be the future of juno, but each item will be voted independently with its own budget attached. With this proposal we are not approving any specific budget yet.

The roadmap proposed is to be consider as a "bridge" phase, with the final objective when the network is ready to switch back to a completly decentralized organizational structure. This might happen in 2026, sooner or later based on factors that we can't predict at this point.
