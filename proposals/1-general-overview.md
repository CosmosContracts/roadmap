# Juno Roadmap: Proposal 1 - General Overview

## Summary

**Purpose:**

Juno Network is currently at a critical juncture, facing significant challenges. At present, there is no dedicated team responsible for maintaining and optimizing the blockchain infrastructure to ensure its stability, scalability, and efficiency. Additionally, no substantial development or other ecosystem activities are underway. To address these issues and establish a sustainable path forward, we propose a roadmap for the network, covering all of 2025. This proposal provides a general overview of Juno’s future direction, but each item will be voted on independently, with its own budget attached. This proposal does not approve any specific budget yet.

The proposed roadmap is intended to serve as a "bridge" phase, with the ultimate goal of transitioning the network back to a completely decentralized organizational structure. This transition could occur in 2026, earlier, or later, depending on unpredictable factors.

## Vision for 2025

### Goals

1. Ensure the network is updated and maintained to guarantee stability, scalability, and efficiency.
2. Increase network activity and community engagement.
3. Establish the foundation for collaboration with other projects within and outside the Interchain ecosystem.
4. Expand the user base, including both developers and end-users.
5. Improve communication about new developments on Juno and ensure comprehensive coverage of released features through popular marketing initiatives.
6. Implement adequate checks and balances for teams working on the network.
7. Ensure the network’s long-term sustainability with a diversified treasury and incentives.
