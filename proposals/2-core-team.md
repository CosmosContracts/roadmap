## Transparency

As writte in [Proposal 1](./1-general-overview.md) we want to keep the community updated on the progress of the network. To do so we will be publishing a report every quarter, detailing the status of the network and the activities of the teams. And we'll run community calls to talk about the work being done and share development updates.

## Budget

The majority of the work is targeting Q1, therefore we propose to have two budgets: one for Q1 and one for the continuous activities that will be done during all 2025
