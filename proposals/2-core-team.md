# Juno Roadmap: Proposal 2 - Core team

## Summary

With this proposal, we suggest appointing two teams: Kintsugi Tech and Digital Kitchen, to focus on the maintenance and upgrade of the Juno Blockchain Core. Each team will have distinct responsibilities and will report directly to the community.

**Who is Kintsugi Tech?**

Kintsugi Tech is a validator & software development company founded in 2022 by me (dimi) and some partners, dedicated to advancing decentralized technology with innovative solutions. We operate may validators inside and outside the Cosmos Ecosystem, and we have a long experience developing on CosmWasm & Cosmos-SDK. Our team is small (only ~8 people) but highly specialized in the fied, and we are currently focused on expanding our operations to contribute even more. Some of the work we did recently, include: custom ui for [Namada mainnet genesis](https://x.com/namada/status/1841105851488354504), [DeQuiz dApp](https://dequiz.zone/) on Juno, Cosmos-SDK upgrade for [Firmachain](https://medium.com/firmachain/firmachain-roadmap-2024-with-a-summary-of-the-progress-made-in-2023-d47cb60b8b22) and more. You can read more about our work in the old and [expired proposal](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/council/blob/main/departments/development/rfp/006-Community_owned_DEX/submission_1/initial_proposal.pdf) for Mercury Dex we proposed to the charter a while ago. For us collaborating with Juno is a huge opportuninty, but also a bet. If everything goes well, both Juno and Kintsugi will benefit from the collaboration, if it doesn't work not only we would have wasted time but probably we would be sitting on a huge bag of worthless tokens. We really believe that with our efforts we can make the network shine again.

## Transparency

As outlined in [Proposal 1](./1-general-overview.md), we aim to keep the community informed about the network’s progress. To achieve this, we will publish a quarterly report detailing the network’s status and the activities of the teams. Additionally, we will host community calls to discuss ongoing work and share development updates.

## Budget

The majority of the work will take place in Q1. Therefore, we propose two budgets: one for Q1 and one for the continuous activities throughout 2025.

### Q1 Budget

| Team            | Budget                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Digital Kitchen | 12,000 USDC – To be paid 1/3 upon approval of this proposal and 2/3 after the upgrade to SDK v50 |
| Kintsugi Tech   | No funding required                                                                              |

### Continuous Budget

| Team            | Budget                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Digital Kitchen | 20,000 JUNO – To be paid at the end of each quarter, contingent on feedback and work logs |
| Kintsugi Tech   | 20,000 JUNO – To be paid at the end of each quarter, contingent on feedback and work logs |

### Totals

- **To be paid in Q1:** 12,000 USDC
- **Quarterly payments after Q1:** 20,000 JUNO + 20,000 JUNO
- **Total expenditure by the end of 2025:** 12,000 USDC + 120,000 JUNO

## Budget Handling

All the budget for 2025 will be allocated to a wallet controlled by Dimi, who will then set up a smart contract controlled by the community to handle recurring payments (on DAODAO). The community can cancel the payments at any time.

### Price disclosure

The budgets have been calculated based on a $JUNO price of $0.20. In case of price fluctuations, the budget will be adjusted according to market conditions, with a maximum multiplier of 4x and a minimum multiplier of 0.25x.
